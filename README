Installation (MacOS):
 - Install tesseract -> "sudo port install tesseract"
 - Install English tesseract language -> "sudo port install tesseract-eng"
 - Install spaCy dependencies:
 	- "pip install spacy"
 	- "python -m spacy download pt_core_news_sm"
 - Set up virtual environment:
 	- Download get-pip.py from: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/
 	- In the directory with that file, run "python get-pip.py"
 	- In the project directory, run "pip install pipenv"
 	- To enter virtual environment, run "pipenv shell"
 		- From here, should be able to run scripts

 Run (textualizer):
 - Enter virtual environment
 - Run "python textualize.py -d <the name of the folder of the children's book to textualize>"


 Ideas:
 - Breakdown of word types
 - Plot the average difficulty of the words on the page from beginning to end of the book
 - Find a way for it to automatically detect the right letter
 - If we label with the correct label:
 	- Same thing as above, but across letters
 - Statistics of text overall (readability metrics, num words, other metrics in my thesis)
 - Color analyzer
 - Entity extractor
 - Should be able to use the labeling to separate texts by letter
 - Analyze complexity of the candidate words across the book
 - Extraction of key phrases?
 - Correlations between letters and colors?
 - Assess the reading level of the texts (mhetrick)
 - Something with time?
 - If can extract the letter word:
 	- total the number of times each word comes up (eomalley)
